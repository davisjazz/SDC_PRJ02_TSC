In this process, we do not want the gradients go out of control. Then all preprocessed images are centered around zero by subtracting the mean, and normalized by dividing by the standard deviation. This technique doesn't change the content of the image. It avoids the values of weights and biases to get too big or to small. It tackles the numerical stability issue that occurs when several small values are added to big values (introducing a lot of errors) during the optimization of the Loss function.\n",
